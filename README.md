# Mayyar Lateness Calculator

## Overview
The Mayyar Lateness Calculator is a fun Python app that estimates how late Mayyar will be based on various factors. Mayyar is a close friend of mine who's almost always late. I've noticed some patterns in his behavior and continue to find more, so instead of just waiting around, I created this calculator to estimate his true arrival time.

## Features
- Takes Mayyar's initial time estimate.
- Adjusts based on influencing factors:
  - Under influence?
  - Pooped today?
  - Father visiting?
- Interactive GUI using **Tkinter**.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repo:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mayyar-lateness-calculator.git
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```
   python mayyar_lateness_calculator.py
   ```
3. Enter the time estimate and answer the questions to get an adjusted estimate.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually pre-installed)
- NumPy
